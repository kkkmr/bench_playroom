# bench_playroom 🧪⚖️
> where ideas stretch, squeeze, break and rebuild yet remain bulletproof

Welcome to **bench_playroom** — a lab for UI experiments, component patterns, CSS puzzles, and animation adventures.  
Here, nothing is final and everything is on trial.

## 💡 Purpose  
This is a creative frontend sandbox where I test ideas, refine design patterns, and prototype scalable, accessible components—drawing from both software engineering.

## 🚀 What You'll Find  
- Experimental React components  
- CSS-only design tricks (clip-paths, layered gradients, hover effects)  
- Accessibility-first UI tests (ARIA, keyboard UX, screen reader behavior)  
- Layout explorations, i18n setups, and micro-interaction demos  
- Lessons learned & decisions documented  

## 👨‍⚖️ Why “Bench”?  
Because even when I’m off-product, I’m never off-purpose.  
This is where I stay sharp, stay curious, and stretch the boundaries of frontend design.
